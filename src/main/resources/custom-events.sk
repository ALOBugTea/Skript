# This file allows you to register custom events that aren't already registered under Skript.
# The event classes you want to register must exist in the server class loader. So events from Paper/Spigot.
# If you want to register an event from a plugin API, you must edit the plugin.yml in the jar of Skript to include:
#
# softdepend: [YourPlugin, SQLibrary, Vault, WorldGuard, Residence, PreciousStones, GriefPrevention]
#
# Reminder to maintain any existing defined plugins in this array as this example should not be directly copied.
#! Additions or changes to this file requires a server restart.

#! Internal version of this configuration. Don't modify.
version: 1

# The format must include a section where the section name is the event name.
# The event section must include:
# 	description - describing the event
#	class - the class name to search for
# 	pattern - the syntax pattern of the event
# The optional pattern [on] gets prefixed on every Skript event.
# Pattern cannot have expressions inside currently.
# event-values of subclass events will be automatically applied.
# If you need more info, make an issue report at https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/issues

# Examples are placed below. The 'enabled' node is not required, it's just to disable examples.
